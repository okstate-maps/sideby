# Installing pre-requisites
1. Install Git (via https://git-scm.com/downloads) and optionally GitHub (https://desktop.github.com).
2. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
3. Install Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install)

# Installing and locally serving the app
1. Clone (https://github.com/okstate-maps/sideby.git) or fork the repo.
2. Open your command line application (**cmd** in Windows, **terminal** in Mac).
3. Enter the directory (`cd sideby` or whatever name of the directory you cloned into).
4. Run the install script using `yarn install`. This installs all of Sideby's dependencies and will take awhile.
4. Start the server using `yarn start`.
5. The app should automatically open in your default browser. You can also manually go to [`localhost:3000`](localhost:3000) in any other browser. Anytime you save a change, the app will reload automatically (some CSS changes require a manual refresh). `src/LayersInfo.js` contains the layer information. Check out the file for some explanation.

## Coming soon
More detail and instructions are forthcoming.
